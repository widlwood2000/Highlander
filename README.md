R Statistical Probability 
Hi my friends call me woody, 
I started programing computers in the 8th and 9th grades [IBMs 360/50 APL] 
skipped to the 11th grade was offered a jump to the 12th but hay who wants to move from a freshman to senior. 
I programed in BASIC my 12th grade year finishing in advanced calculus gaining an offer from Clemson for a full computer science
scholarship. I had already made a commitment to the USMC so missed that boat.   
Just started programming in R for my graduate statistical probability needs data mining.
Woody
